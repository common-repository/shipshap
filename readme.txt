This plugin integrates your store with Shipshap, allowing you to get rates and execute payments

== Description ==

The Shipshap plugin allows you to get rates from a multitude of shipment providers via Shipshap in your store, as well as collect
payments via Shipshap.

For payment collection, we allow:

1. Credit cards
2. M-Pesa

The plugin requires WooCommerce to properly work in your store

Remember to check our Terms of Service ( https://shipshap.com/terms )

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Do I need a SKU for all my products?

No. Although a SKU is recommended to allow for a unique identifier that can move from one product to another, we will fallback to the
product ID. The only caveat is that if you later need to create a new product meant to replace this old product, we will see it as a
brand new product.

* Do I need to set dimensions (length, weight etc) in all my products?

No, you can set a default in the admin. But it is very important to understand that wrong dimensions could lead to wrong rates, specially
in international shipments. This could cause your customer to underpay for the rate, or possibly see a rate much higher than it should be.

* Where do I get the needed tokens to add to the settings page?
